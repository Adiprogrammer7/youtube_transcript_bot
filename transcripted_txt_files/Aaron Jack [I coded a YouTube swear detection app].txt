did you know the movie wolf of wall
street has the most swears of any movie
of all time
this movie's got 715 swear words 569 of
which
are the f word if you look at the
wikipedia page they even give a squares
per minute measurement
which is 2.51 by the way now let's talk
about youtube
people have been saying that they either
get less money or completely demonetized
at times if they
swear too much in a video i'm not sure
whether this is true or not but either
way
i thought it would be fun to make our
own square detection bot that can run on
different channels
and we can do some cool with it
like ring channels compared to each
other
come up with a profanity score for how
edgy your channel is and of course get
the swears per minute to see if anyone
can beat wolf of wall street so that's
what we're gonna do in this video
i have no idea if it's gonna work you
guys so
we'll see what happens and if you're
wondering i
swear this is a good use of my time i
swear
you get it to score a channel we have to
take a sample of its videos
let's just say the most recent 10. we'll
pull out the swear words
with code and then get the average
squares per minute across
all these videos and finally rinse and
repeat for as many channels as we want
the first thing i thought would be to
download the video with some code
and then send it to a speech to text api
luckily google has one of these where
you can send any video
or music clip and extract the words so
that makes it really easy
this will give us a video transcript
that we can start pulling swear words
out of
and doing different things with so a
pretty good solution right
wrong it is actually against in terms of
service to download
any youtube video off the platform so we
need another plan
i cannot believe i didn't think of this
first but there's an entire youtube data
api just for developers where you can
download things like
uh i don't know the auto generated
captions for a video that gives you a
whole transcript all it takes is setting
up credentials which is
kind of a pain in the ass and reading
the documentation which is
definitely a pain in the ass but if you
can do that you can pull
a lot of different kinds of data from
the site once you do that you can write
some code like this
which will get you a list of the
captions in all the different languages
uh pull you out a single caption and
then right around this line is where you
realize oh you can't actually get
captions from any video
that you don't own so that was just a
huge waste of time
now as annoying as that was i did
discover one super valuable thing
it turns out when you press the little
caption button it goes to fetch the
captions from a url
now if you copy that url you can
actually see all the captions
but it's not quite that simple and
unfortunately it never
is in fact coding is kind of just like
solving one problem and then another one
comes up in its place
uh over and over again that's actually
pretty depressing
now for one minute of nerd that it
didn't take me long to figure out at all
we create some web scripting code
that'll open a chrome window and then
click on that caption button now when
that happens we fire off an xhr request
or asynchronous
request that we have to also set a
listener for in our
scraping code within that xxr request
there's a property for that url which we
can capture
but this url isn't always in english if
you're pewdiepie you have
13 different subtitles so luckily we can
solve this one just by directly changing
the url string
setting language to english and making
sure we're using the auto generated
subtitles which should always be there
now we can see the subtitles in here but
it's in this weird json structure that
youtube is able to
read but we're not youtube and we don't
want any of this bs we just want to
extract the raw transcript
and this code right here does just that
converting this mess into a clean
single string of subtitles and just like
that we can get the subtitles for any
different video on youtube
i'm glad you stuck with me through that
now the fun part
the swearing parsing out the swear words
is easy we just have to count the number
of appearances of each word we want to
look for
then we can divide the total number by
the length of the video to get swear
words per minute
after a while code can get pretty boring
to look at even for me
so what i did next was create a pretty
simple front end that allows you to put
in any video url and see how many swear
words there are
in it all you have to do is paste in a
video url and it will
tell you exactly what you want to know
okay we are definitely not done until we
find out who is the profanity king or
queen
of youtube we have to rank channels
compared
to each other now of course we want to
get squares per minute but not all
squares are created equal let's be
honest
so what i did was give each swear to
rank from logan paul fan
all the way up to your cancelled which
allowed me to create the swear word
index
this lets us give every channel a meta
score in addition to the swears per
minute
which is kind of a more accurate
representation of how profane
the channel is with a bit more web
scripting we can capture all the recent
video urls for a given channel
so we'll run this on one channel first
to make sure it works
just don't try to scrape all the videos
at the same time and crash your computer
uh i'm not sure who would do that you
know what just forget i said that
anyway once it works it's just a matter
of running this on as many channels as i
can think of
i wanted to get a list of the top 100
channels and rented on all of them but
more than half of them are actually
music or foreign so that wouldn't work
on either of those
to filter these down well that would be
a bunch of extra work so i'm just
manually putting in as many as i can and
then having them run all right i could
think of this many people
before my head started to hurt we got
some fortnite players we got
some comedians we got some comedians
and uh disclaimer i do not watch all
these channels they're just the ones i
can think of
now some of these are clearly going to
swear a little bit more than others but
we'll see if anyone can break that wolf
or wall street
benchmark of swears per minute now for
the best part
you can just sit back and watch your
code run
just sit back and watch your code
all right it usually doesn't work on the
first time but when it does work
that's a good feeling
all right how'd it go well not every
video worked
and then we might have had a few errors
up here but
we're just gonna pretend those didn't
happen all right but
when we look at our database we got 27
channels
so that's not too bad and if you
multiply that out we looked at 270
videos so i'm gonna build a front end to
display
the channels with their rankings uh to
see who came out on top
looks like trevor wallace edges out
michael reeves
for the number one spot but no one got
even close to wolf of wall street
we've got swears per minute and then the
meta score converts into a little
ranking
on the side here for the scale we've got
hardcore
edgy wholesome and then pristine or not
even a single swear in
10 videos which is pretty impressive
when you think about it
and i have to say i'm a little bit
surprised that some people in this list
filthy frank not as filthy as these
other guys
was this idea dumb you know what don't
answer that
but if you do have other project ideas
let me know in a comment
i'm going to be doing a lot more
projects so feel free to subscribe
if you're not subscribed anyway i'll
catch you guys in the next video
